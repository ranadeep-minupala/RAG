================================================================================

Last Updated: February 6, 2026
Policy Reference: FIN-POL-001 v2.3

This FAQ document addresses common questions about our Corporate Expense Policy.
For questions not covered here, contact expense@company.com


================================================================================
SECTION 1: GENERAL QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q1.1: Who does this expense policy apply to?
A: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and 
temporary workers who incur business-related expenses on behalf of the company.

Q1.2: Where can I find the complete expense policy?
A: The full policy is available on the company intranet at 
intranet.company.com/policies/expense-policy. You should review the complete 
policy document to understand all requirements.

Q1.3: What happens if I need to spend more than the policy limits allow?
A: You must request a policy exception BEFORE incurring the expense. Submit an 
Exception Request Form with business justification. Approval requirements:
- Up to 50% over limit: Department head approval
- 51-100% over limit: Finance Director approval
- Over 100% of limit: CFO approval
If you exceed limits without pre-approval, reimbursement may be denied.

Q1.4: I'm new to the company. How do I learn about the expense policy?
A: New employees must complete expense policy training within 30 days of hire. 
This is covered in your onboarding. Your manager will review your first expense 
report with you for coaching. Training modules are also available on the 
learning management system.

Q1.5: How often is the expense policy updated?
A: The policy is comprehensively reviewed every January. Minor updates may 
occur quarterly as needed. You'll receive email notification of any changes, 
and the updated policy will be posted on the intranet. You must acknowledge 
major policy updates within 30 days.


================================================================================
SECTION 2: RECEIPTS AND DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

Q2.1: Do I need receipts for all my expenses?
A: Original itemized receipts are required for all expenses over $25. For 
expenses under $25, receipts are recommended but not required if your total 
daily expenses remain within the per diem limit. Always keep receipts as proof.

Q2.2: What if I lose a receipt?
A: Submit a Lost Receipt Affidavit (available from Finance Department) with 
your expense report. Include:
- Explanation of the expense
- Why the receipt was lost
- Any supporting documentation (credit card statement, confirmation email)
- Manager approval required for lost receipts over $50
- Maximum 3 lost receipt affidavits per quarter per employee

Q2.3: Can I submit photos of receipts instead of originals?
A: Yes! Digital photos or scans are acceptable. Make sure the image is clear 
and shows all required information: date, vendor name, itemized purchases, 
total amount, and payment method. We recommend photographing receipts 
immediately to prevent loss.

Q2.4: Are credit card statements acceptable as receipts?
A: No. Credit card statements alone are NOT acceptable proof of expense. You 
must provide itemized receipts showing what was purchased. Credit card 
statements can be used as supplementary documentation, especially for foreign 
currency conversion.

Q2.5: What information must be on a valid receipt?
A: A valid receipt must clearly show:
- Date of purchase
- Vendor/merchant name and location
- Itemized list of goods or services purchased
- Total amount paid
- Form of payment
Receipts without this information may be rejected.

Q2.6: Do I need to keep paper copies if I submit digital receipts?
A: No. Once you've submitted clear digital copies, you can discard paper 
receipts. However, we recommend keeping them until reimbursement is received, 
just in case there are questions.

Q2.7: What if the receipt is in a foreign language?
A: For receipts in foreign languages, provide:
- The original receipt
- A brief translation or explanation of the main items
- The exchange rate used for conversion
- Your credit card statement showing the converted amount is also helpful


================================================================================
SECTION 3: TRAVEL EXPENSES
================================================================================

Q3.1: When can I fly business class or premium economy?
A: Economy class is standard for all flights. Premium economy may be approved 
for flights over 5 hours with manager pre-approval. Business class requires VP 
approval and is typically only approved for flights over 8 hours.

Q3.2: Can I use Uber or Lyft for business travel?
A: Yes! Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft are acceptable for business 
travel up to $75 per trip. Choose standard service (UberX, Lyft) rather than 
premium options. Keep the electronic receipt from the app.

Q3.3: Can I be reimbursed for mileage when using my personal vehicle?
A: Yes. Mileage reimbursement is $0.67 per mile (IRS 2024 standard rate). For 
trips over 100 miles, you need manager pre-approval. You must provide:
- Starting point and destination
- Business purpose
- Odometer readings or MapQuest/Google Maps distance
- Date of travel

Q3.4: My flight was delayed and I had to buy a meal at the airport. Is this covered?
A: Yes, airport meals during business travel are covered under your daily meal 
per diem of $50/day. Keep the receipt if the meal costs over $25. The meal 
amount counts toward your daily per diem limit.

Q3.5: Can I earn frequent flyer miles or hotel points on business travel?
A: Yes! You may keep and use frequent flyer miles, hotel points, and other 
loyalty program benefits earned during business travel. However, you must still 
book the most economical option—don't choose a more expensive flight just to 
earn miles.

Q3.6: What if I want to extend my business trip for personal reasons?
A: Personal extensions are allowed but must be clearly separated from business 
expenses:
- Only business travel days are reimbursable
- Compare the cost of business-only travel vs. extended travel
- If extension costs MORE (change fees, extra nights), you pay the difference
- If extension costs the SAME or LESS (Saturday night stay discount), it's acceptable
- Get manager approval before booking
- Clearly mark personal days on your expense report

Q3.7: My meeting ended early. Can I fly home early?
A: Yes, if you can change your flight without penalty. However, change fees are 
not reimbursable unless required for business reasons. Check if your ticket 
allows free same-day changes.

Q3.8: What should I do if my flight is cancelled?
A: If your flight is cancelled:
1. Work with the airline to rebook on the next available flight
2. If overnight stay is required, book hotel within policy limits ($150/night)
3. Keep all receipts and documentation
4. Explain the situation in your expense report
5. Airline-imposed change fees for cancellations are reimbursable

Q3.9: Can I use airport parking?
A: Yes, airport parking is reimbursable up to $25/day. If rates exceed this, 
consider alternative transportation like ride-sharing, which may be more 
cost-effective. Long-term/economy parking lots are preferred over short-term.

Q3.10: Is travel insurance reimbursable?
A: No, travel insurance purchased individually is not reimbursable. The company 
provides travel insurance coverage for all business travelers through our 
corporate policy. Contact HR for details about coverage.


================================================================================
SECTION 4: ACCOMMODATION
================================================================================

Q4.1: What if the only available hotels exceed the $150/night limit?
A: If you're traveling to a high-cost city or during peak season:
1. Try to book early to get better rates
2. Use the company's preferred hotel booking tool for discounts
3. If necessary, request a policy exception with justification
4. Consider hotels slightly outside the city center for lower rates
5. Document that you searched for options within policy

Q4.2: Can I use Airbnb or VRBO instead of hotels?
A: Short-term rentals may be used if they're comparable in cost to hotels and 
booked through recognized platforms (Airbnb, VRBO). They must still meet the 
$150/night limit. For safety and accountability, avoid renting rooms in 
someone's home—entire apartments or condos are preferred.

Q4.3: Are hotel taxes and fees included in the $150 limit?
A: No. Lodging taxes and mandatory resort fees are reimbursable in addition to 
the $150 nightly rate. However, discretionary fees (early check-in, late 
check-out for personal convenience) are not covered.

Q4.4: Can I stay with family or friends instead of a hotel?
A: Yes, this is encouraged as it saves the company money. While you won't be 
reimbursed for accommodation, you may give your host a reasonable thank-you 
gift (under $50) which is reimbursable. Document this on your expense report.

Q4.5: What hotel amenities can I use?
A: Basic amenities included in your room rate are fine (WiFi, fitness center, 
pool). However, you cannot claim:
- Room service
- Minibar charges
- In-room movies or entertainment
- Spa or massage services
- Hotel laundry (unless trip exceeds 5 nights)
- Premium WiFi or upgraded services

Q4.6: What if I need to check out late for a business meeting?
A: Late check-out fees are reimbursable if required for business reasons (late 
meeting, evening flight). Note the business justification on your expense 
report. Late check-out for personal convenience is not covered.

Q4.7: Can I share a hotel room with a colleague to save money?
A: Sharing is not required, but it's appreciated when colleagues voluntarily 
share to reduce costs. Each person should have their own bed. If sharing, only 
one person should claim the room expense to avoid duplication.


================================================================================
SECTION 5: MEALS AND PER DIEM
================================================================================

Q5.1: How does the $50/day meal per diem work?
A: The $50/day covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidentals (tips, taxes). 
You can spend it however you want across the day:
- Receipts required for individual meals over $25
- First and last travel day: 75% of per diem ($37.50)
- You don't need to spend exactly $50—it's a maximum daily limit
- Unspent per diem is not paid out to you

Q5.2: What if my hotel includes free breakfast?
A: If meals are provided free (by hotel, conference, or client), deduct from 
your per diem:
- Breakfast: $7.50 (15% of daily rate)
- Lunch: $12.50 (25% of daily rate)
- Dinner: $20.00 (40% of daily rate)
So if breakfast is included, your per diem for that day is $42.50 ($50 - $7.50).

Q5.3: Can I claim alcohol on my expense report?
A: Alcoholic beverages are NOT reimbursable under the standard meal per diem. 
However, alcohol may be approved for client entertainment (up to $75 total) 
with manager pre-approval and clear business justification.

Q5.4: What's considered a "high-cost city" for meals?
A: High-cost cities include: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, 
Washington DC, Seattle, and similar major metros. Per diem is $55/day instead 
of $50/day. Check with Finance if you're unsure about your destination.

Q5.5: Can I take a client to lunch or dinner?
A: Yes, client meals require manager pre-approval. You must:
- Get approval BEFORE the meal
- Include names of all attendees and their company affiliations
- Document the business purpose and expected outcome
- Keep itemized receipt
- Alcohol up to $75 may be approved for client entertainment

Q5.6: I'm traveling with colleagues. Can we have a team dinner?
A: Team meals during business travel require department head pre-approval. 
There must be a clear business purpose (project planning meeting, team 
offsite). Social team dinners without business purpose are generally not 
reimbursable.

Q5.7: What if I have dietary restrictions requiring more expensive meals?
A: If you have medical or religious dietary restrictions requiring more 
expensive meal options:
- Stay within the $50/day limit when possible
- Document the restriction (one-time note in your file)
- Occasional overages will be understood with context
- If consistently over limit, discuss with manager for solution

Q5.8: Do I get per diem for day trips (no overnight stay)?
A: No. Per diem only applies to overnight business travel. For day trips, you 
may claim actual meal expenses if you have a business meeting during meal times 
that prevents you from returning to the office. Manager approval required.

Q5.9: What's included in "incidentals" for the per diem?
A: Incidentals (about 20% of per diem, or $10/day) cover:
- Tips and gratuities on meals
- Service charges
- Small snacks or coffee throughout the day
- Bottled water
These don't need separate receipts—they're covered in your daily per diem.


================================================================================
SECTION 6: ENTERTAINMENT AND CLIENT EXPENSES
================================================================================

Q6.1: What qualifies as "business entertainment"?
A: Business entertainment must serve a clear business purpose:
- Client dinners or lunches
- Hosting prospects at conferences
- Networking events and industry seminars
- Taking clients to sporting events or shows (with VP approval)
- Conference registration fees
All entertainment over $50 requires manager pre-approval.

Q6.2: Can I take my team out for drinks after work?
A: Social team gatherings are generally not reimbursable unless there's a 
specific business purpose (celebrating project completion, team planning 
session). Get department head approval first. Company-wide social events are 
planned separately by HR.

Q6.3: What documentation do I need for entertainment expenses?
A: For all entertainment expenses, provide:
- Itemized receipt
- Names of all attendees
- Company affiliations of attendees
- Business purpose/objective of the meeting
- Expected outcome or result
- Any follow-up planned

Q6.4: Can I give gifts to clients?
A: Client gifts are covered under a separate gift policy (not the expense 
policy). Limit is $100 per client per year. Contact your manager for gift 
policy details.

Q6.5: Are conference registration fees covered?
A: Yes, conference registration fees are reimbursable as professional 
development expenses. They require manager pre-approval before you register. 
Include the conference agenda and business justification with your request.

Q6.6: What about attending sporting events or concerts with clients?
A: Entertainment at sporting events, concerts, or shows requires VP-level 
approval because of the higher cost and perception issues. You must demonstrate 
clear business value and relationship building purpose. Approve before 
purchasing tickets.


================================================================================
SECTION 7: OFFICE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT
================================================================================

Q7.1: What office supplies can I expense?
A: You can claim necessary work supplies up to $25/month:
- Stationery, pens, notebooks, folders
- Printer paper and ink/toner
- Postage and shipping supplies
- Basic desk accessories
- Batteries for work equipment
Use company-approved vendors when possible.

Q7.2: Can I expense a monitor, keyboard, or other equipment?
A: Equipment purchases over $100 require IT or Operations approval, regardless 
of cost. Don't purchase on your own—submit an equipment request through the IT 
department. They'll ensure compatibility and proper asset tracking.

Q7.3: Can I expense software or apps I need for work?
A: Software subscriptions require IT approval regardless of cost. This ensures:
- Security and compliance
- License management
- No duplicate subscriptions
- Proper vendor contracts
Submit a software request ticket to IT before purchasing.

Q7.4: What about ergonomic equipment like a standing desk or special chair?
A: Ergonomic equipment requests go through HR/Facilities, not the expense 
reimbursement process. Contact HR to discuss your needs. They may require a 
doctor's note or ergonomic assessment.

Q7.5: Can I expense books related to my work?
A: Work-related books are considered professional development, not office 
supplies. Manager approval is required. Include the business justification 
(required for certification, directly applicable to current project, etc.).


================================================================================
SECTION 8: SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL
================================================================================

Q8.1: How quickly do I need to submit my expenses?
A: Submit all expenses within 30 calendar days of being incurred. 
- 31-60 days: Requires manager approval
- 61-90 days: Requires department head approval with written justification
- Over 90 days: Generally not reimbursed without Finance Director approval
Submit regularly rather than waiting—weekly or bi-weekly is recommended.

Q8.2: How long does it take to get reimbursed?
A: Properly submitted expenses are reimbursed within 14 business days of 
approval. Complex or high-value expenses may take up to 21 business days. You 
can track status in the expense management system.

A: Reimbursements are paid via direct deposit to your designated bank account 
on file. Payments are processed during the regular bi-weekly payroll cycle. 
Update your banking information in the HR system if it changes.

Q8.4: My manager is on vacation. Who approves my expense report?
A: If your manager is unavailable:
- Expenses under $500: Acting manager or department head can approve
- Expenses over $500: Wait for manager's return if possible, or request 
  exception from department head
- Emergency reimbursements: Contact Finance Department

Q8.5: Can I submit expenses from several months ago all at once?
A: You should submit expenses regularly, not in bulk. However, if you have 
multiple expenses:
- Group by trip or time period
- All must be within 30-day submission window
- Very old expenses (60+ days) need special approval
Submitting regularly (weekly/bi-weekly) is much easier for everyone.

Q8.6: What happens after I submit my expense report?
A: The workflow is:
1. You submit expense report with all documentation
2. Manager reviews and approves/rejects (typically 2-3 business days)
3. Finance processes payment (14 business days)
4. Direct deposit issued during next payroll cycle
5. You receive email notifications at each step

Q8.7: My expense report was rejected. What should I do?
A: If rejected, you'll receive a notification explaining why. Common reasons:
- Missing receipts or documentation
- Out-of-policy expenses without pre-approval
- Insufficient business justification
- Incorrect expense categorization
Correct the issues and resubmit. Contact your manager if you have questions.

Q8.8: Do I need pre-approval for every expense?
A: Pre-approval is required for:
- Any single expense over $500
- Entertainment expenses over $50
- International travel
- Out-of-policy expenses
- Conference attendance requiring travel
- Professional development over $500
Regular small expenses (daily meals, taxi rides under $75, office supplies) 
don't need pre-approval.
